Thoughts for future directions.

* Look for under-reporting in the 2019 WA private school state data. Under-reporting could artifically inflate the estimate of change.
* Incorporate the federal version of the WA private school data.
* Re-run for other district. They are facing enrollment shortfalls and are similarly prohibited by the state for raising money locally to bridge short term deficits.
* Try to model school migration based on housing trends. We all know private enrollment is correlated with home pric. However, separating cause from effect is challenging.
